# Campus-Hiring-Assignment-Design-Implement-SDK-for-Trading-APIs-Bajaj-Broking
This project implements a simplified trading backend using RESTful APIs, simulating core workflows of an online stock broking platform. The system allows users to view instruments, place buy/sell orders, track order status, view executed trades, and fetch portfolio holdings.  No real market connectivity is used. All data is stored in memory.

## Technology Stack

- Language: Python 3.11  
- Framework: FastAPI  
- API Format: REST + JSON  
- Storage: In-memory (Python dictionaries and lists)  
- Documentation: Swagger / OpenAPI (FastAPI auto-generated)
